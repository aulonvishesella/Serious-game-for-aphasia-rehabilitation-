# About the project
This project is a serious game, developed in Unity with scripts written in C#, aimed at the rehabilitation of aphasia with a focus on noun therapy.
This project was a funded research project at my university and was validated by a speech therapist to ensure it can provide desired therapeutic effects

# References
The following references were presented to my speech therapist that were drawn as inspiration, to which I would feature into my game in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effects
