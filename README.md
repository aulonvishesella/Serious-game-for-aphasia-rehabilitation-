# About :computer:
This project is a serious game, developed in Unity with scripts written in C#, aimed at the rehabilitation of aphasia with a focus on noun therapy.
This project was a funded research project at my university and was validated by a speech therapist to ensure it can provide desired therapeutic effects

# What I learnt :rocket:
* Using `Watson IBM Speech to Text API` service to detect and convert user speech into text format; to determine if the user has said the noun correctly.
* Follow an `Incremental Model` consistently throughout development, ensuring each increment was presented and tested alongside a speech therapist.
* Using and designing `state machines` to capture the different animation states the main avatar and NPC's can be, subquently writing scripts to transition between these animations based on the flow of the game.
* Implementing a `Save & Load` system that utilised symmetric encryption; encrypting PlayerData(current score, current level and position of avatar) when writing to a file and decrypting when reading from a file. In order to do this, I had to:
  * Utilise three streams that 'wrapped' the other
    * using `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter`, which reads or writes data from and to a CryptoStream
    * using `CryptoStream`, encrypting player data when writing or decrypting the encrypted data when reading
    * using `FileStream` to read/write data into the file
  * Create an instance of `AES` to generate the shared key and an input IV when writing PlayerData to our file and an output IV when reading from our file. Both the shared key and IV was used by the CryptoStream when encrypting/decrypting data.
  * Serialize PlayerData in a json format using `JsonUtility.ToJson`, which would be the encrypted data written to the file stream. 
  * Deserialize the json data that was read from the file, into a pattern matching the PlayerData class using `JsonUtility.FromJson`, where this decrypted data will be used to load saved data.
  * Implementing Data Structures. For example, the Queue generic class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace was adopted during development to become an integral part of the games dialogue system between the NPC and Avatar.

Some references were presented to my speech therapist that were drawn as inspiration. As this is a serious game, all features included had to be validated with my speech therapist.

# Before you get started ⏸️
This project uses the game engine Unity and uses Unity SDK file in order to use IBM watsons speech to text API 

So:

1. Download Unity
2. You need an IBM Cloud account to generate service credentials; url and apikey.
3. Download the unity SDK file from:https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk and add this inside the game asset
4. Take the script 'ExampleStreaming.cs' from the SDK file, and add this into game component.
5. Paste the service credentials you generated into the empty fields inside the inspector.
